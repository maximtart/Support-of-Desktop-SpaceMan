Desktop Spaceman is a powerful yet lightweight menu bar utility that brings clarity to your macOS Spaces (Virtual Desktops). Instantly see which Space you're currently using—across multiple displays—with a sleek, customizable indicator. Whether you're juggling multiple workspaces or organizing your workflow, Desktop Spaceman makes navigation seamless and intuitive.

Customize your view with four distinct styles: Rectangles, a clean and minimal representation of your Spaces; Numbers, displaying numbered Spaces for quick identification; Rectangles with Numbers, combining both visuals and numerical references; and Named Spaces, allowing you to assign custom names for a personalized workflow.

The menu bar indicator provides a clear overview of your current setup with intuitive icons. The Active Space icon highlights the Space you're currently working in, while Inactive Space icons represent other available Spaces on the same display. Inactive Fullscreen App icons indicate fullscreen applications that are not currently in focus, and a Gap denotes the transition between displays, helping you distinguish multiple monitors. Active Fullscreen App icons show which fullscreen application is currently in use.

With Desktop Spaceman, managing your virtual desktops has never been easier. Stay organized, improve efficiency, and navigate your macOS Spaces with confidence!
